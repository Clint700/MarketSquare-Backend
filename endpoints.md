Here is a well-organized table that breaks down the API tests for the MarketSquare Supermarket app. The table includes the HTTP method, API endpoint, role access (Admin, Customer, or Both), and a list of test cases for each endpoint.

API Test Cases Table

POST	/api/auth/register	Customer	- Should register a new customer - Should fail with missing fields - Should fail if username/email exists
GET	/api/auth/me	Both	- Should return current user’s details (admin or customer) - Should fail if unauthenticated

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Access	Test Cases
POST	/api/products	Admin	- Should allow admin to create new product - Should fail if required fields are missing - Should deny non-admin
PATCH	/api/products/:product_id	Admin	- Should allow admin to update product - Should return 404 if product doesn’t exist - Should deny non-admin
DELETE	/api/products/:product_id	Admin	- Should allow admin to delete product - Should return 404 if product doesn’t exist - Should deny non-admin
GET	/api/products	Both	- Should return list of products - Should paginate results - Should filter by category, price, etc.

HTTP Method	Endpoint	Access	Test Cases
POST	/api/orders	Customer	- Should allow customer to place an order - Should fail if cart is empty - Should fail if product is unavailable

PATCH	/api/admin/orders/:order_id	Admin	- Should allow admin to update order status (e.g., mark as shipped) - Should return 404 if order doesn’t exist
GET	/api/admin/products	Admin	- Should return list of all products - Should deny non-admin access

Additional Tests:

	•	Authorization Tests: Ensure customers cannot access admin routes, and vice versa.
	•	Error Handling: Test edge cases (e.g., product not found, insufficient stock, etc.).
	•	Pagination and Filtering: Test APIs that return lists of products or orders for correct pagination and filtering logic.

Final Notes:

This table provides a clear structure for writing and organizing your API tests. Each API endpoint has its role-specific access rules and test cases that you can implement with a testing framework like Jest, Mocha, or Supertest.

If you need help writing specific test cases or integrating these tests with your backend, feel free to ask!
